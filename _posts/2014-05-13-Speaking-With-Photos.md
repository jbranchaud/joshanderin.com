I love sharing stories and experiences through my photography. My plan this
year was to upload tons of photos each week as the year progressed. However,
as I got more and more involved in life and work here in Argentina, it
became a difficult to keep up with all the editing and uploading. I still
post photos that I shoot with my Nikon to
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jbranchaud/) when I can. Though I
cannot say I do so as often as I wish I did.

I have been able to start expressing myself more frequently through photography the
past couple months though. With the help of my phone and Instagram, I have
been posting almost daily glimpses into life in and around Grand Bourg as I
see it. If you are interested in what I am up to and what life in Argentina
can look like, check out [my photos on Instagram](http://instagram.com/jbranchaud).
