title: That is the Peace

In church this morning we celebrated a service for peace in honor of the
International Day of Prayer for Peace. The weekend also coincides with the
Día de la Primavera, the first day of spring, which is celebrated on the
same day as the Día del Estudiante, the day of the student. All three of
these festive days combined this morning such that the sanctuary was
decorated with paper cutouts of flowers and doves, and the children and
youth were involved in the planning of the service.

(It is also worth noting that we had to wear winter coats to church this
morning, and all last week. It is traditional for students to have a
day off school to go on picnics all weekend, but no such luck this year.
Josh commented that this is exactly like Nebraska weather.)

We are used to correlating the new life of spring with the celebration of
Easter, since for the Northern Hemisphere the two coincide. But here it was
beautiful to think instead about what spring has to do with peace. The gospel
reading for the day was the parable of the shrewd manager (Luke 16:1-13), so
we were also thinking about the subject of money and how that relates to
peace.

When we talk about peace, we must talk about more than the absence of war.
War, both in Argentina and in the United States, is
far removed from our daily experiences, so to talk about peace only as the
antonym of war
is to say that peace has little to do with the actions that we take every
day. Instead, to think of peace as a reality in which new life springs forth
and is able to grow, allows us to imagine how we might participate in
bringing about such a reality.

On Saturday with Pastor Eva and the youth, we planned an activity for the
service for peace to illustrate how each one of us can participate in
building peace in our community and in the world. In front of the sanctuary
was a drawing of a dove that represented peace. Each youth taped a word or
phrase to the dove that represented a ‘wound’ – violence, war, death,
injustice, corruption, usury, children in the street, unequal distribution
of wealth, lack of access to education, mistreatment of others, robbery,
assault. With the parable of the shrewd manager in mind, we noted that most
of these wounds had to do with money, whether explicitly or otherwise.

During the service, the youth explained that, in our world, peace is
wounded, and we are called to be part of the healing. They handed out
‘band-aids’ made of masking tape, and asked parishioners to write on them
what they can do to build peace. One by one each person came to the front
and taped their band-aids over the dove’s wounds, reading aloud their
contribution.

Afterwards we had a dove that was still not quite whole, but that at least
had its wounds covered with something better. We know that we can’t heal the
brokenness of the world on our own, but we do our part and trust that God is
working in us and in others to bring healing.

We sang a song called “Embajadores” today, which really struck me. I
included a translation of part of it here to share with you. May it inspire
in you a new vision of peace: peace as the 'rich fruit of justice;' peace,
which breaks down that which divides us; peace, which fosters new life, just
like the new life that is sprouting in Grand Bourg this spring. May that
peace be with you today.

**Ambassadors**  
*Federico Pagura - Homero Perera*

> The human heart breathes for peace:  
> Peace, not simply the absence of war;  
> Peace, not the silence of a tomb;  
> Peace, not a mere escape from reality.  
> <br />
> For peace, which is the warmth of brotherly love;  
> For peace, which is well-being and joy;  
> For peace, which is the rich fruit of justice  
> and has its foundation and its guarantee in God.  
> <br />
> That is the peace that Christ brings to the world,  
> breaking down walls and borders,  
> opening for us pathways of hope,  
> and renewing for us eternal life.  
> <br />
> That is the peace that today we are called  
> to proclaim to every continent:  
> a new kind of ambassadors,  
> in the name of Jesus our living Lord.
