Once a year March 14th rolls around and people get all excited about pie. For those that aren't sure why, it is because the date 3/14 corresponds to the mathematical value 3.14, better known as Pi. This day has grown increasingly popular in the past few years in the US. People usually celebrate by heading over to Village Inn for pie (I think they offer a slice for free this day) or by making a pie at home.

We haven't seen any Village Inns in Argentina yet, so we opted for the former. Actually, I wasn't all that excited about making a pie, but Erin insisted. I am glad she did. I ended up making the crust from scratch and she did the rest: preparing the peaches, making the filling, and baking it. It was delicious as I am sure you can see from the picture above.
