As our departure for Argentina quickly approaches, Erin and I will be doing
some reading to prepare us for the year ahead. I had already been planning
on reading
[The Motorcycle Diaries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motorcycle_Diaries_%28book%29),
a memoir by
[Che Guevara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_%22Che%22_Guevara).
Now, some Amazon 2-day shipping has quickly expanded that reading list.

We are now equipped with a diverse stack of books that should give us a
range of perspectives and insights on this country. The following is our
current reading list (though I am sure it will grow):

- [Argentina](http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Argentina-Country-Guide/dp/174220015X)
by [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/)
- [The Fitful Republic: Economy, Society, and Politics in
  Argentina](http://www.amazon.com/The-Fitful-Republic-Argentina-Perspectives/dp/0813301106)
  by Juan E. Corradi
- [The Motorcycle Diaries: Notes on a Latin American Journey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motorcycle_Diaries_%28book%29)
