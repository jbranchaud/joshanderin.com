One of the very first things we learned about Argentina, even before we set
foot here, was the importance of *mate* (pronounced MAH-tay). In our time in
Grand Bourg, we have continued to learn more about the traditions and
sentiments that surround this drink, which is by law the "national
infusion."

Mate is like a loose-leaf tea that you drink in a special gourd (also called
a *mate*) with a special straw called a *bombilla* that filters out most of the
leaves. You can drink mate alone, but the vast majority of the time it is
drunk in community. One person is the *cebador*, and s/he pours hot water over
the dry *yerba mate* leaves. First s/he drinks the mate until the water is
mostly gone and the straw makes a sucking sound, then pours more water and
passes the mate to the next person. That person drinks until the water is
gone, and then passes it back to the cebador, and so on.

Mate is drunk at social gatherings, at official meetings, at parties…
really, anytime several people are gathered, mate is there (insert sarcastic
reference to Matthew 18:20 here). Even when it is impractical to drink mate,
in choir practice for example, where both our hands and our mouths are
otherwise occupied, mate is drunk anyway.

Mate is a beautiful way to practice sharing in community. Everyone drinks
out of the same mate gourd and uses the same bombilla. Depending on the
number of people sharing the mate, several minutes might pass before it’s
your turn to drink again. So if you’re looking simply to satisfy your thirst
or benefit from the caffeine, it would be better to drink a bottle of Coke
all by yourself. Mate is not primarily about thirst or caffeine, but about
togetherness and friendship.

There are a few individuals and families that pass by our church every so
often to ask for a small bag of food to help them get by. These bags usually
include rice, lentils, sugar, flour, and… mate. Josh noted that at
first glance, mate seems to be the odd thing out in these bags. The other
items are staples; basic things that help the person survive. Mate, on the
other hand, doesn’t provide any physical nourishment, yet it is always
included in these basic food kits. Why?

We have come to realize that mate doesn’t satisfy a physical need, but rather satisfies a social,
emotional, spiritual need for community and identity. Mate is part of being
an Argentinean, just like eating is part of being human. In providing mate
for these families, the church is helping not only to sustain them
physically, but also to sustain their dignity as Argentinean people.

How have we as the wider Church succeeded and failed to sustain the dignity
of the people with whom we are in ministry? How can we begin to care for our
neighbors as whole people, with needs that are physical, emotional, social,
spiritual?
