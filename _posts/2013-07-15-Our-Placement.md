Greetings! This post marks the beginning of this blog and the beginning of a
new chapter in our lives. Beginning August 14th, we will spend a year in
Argentina through the Young Adults in Global Mission Program
([YAGM](http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Global-Mission/Engage-in-Global-Mission/Global-Service/Basics-of-Global-Service/Young-Adults.aspx))
through the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
([ELCA](http://www.elca.org/)). We hope that this blog
will be a way for you to accompany us as we journey!

This week, we found out our specific site placements – in what country,
city, community, and congregation we will be serving. We had been anxiously
awaiting this piece of information for months (in part because it’s not
super catchy to announce that we are going to “Argentina slash Uruguay”), so
we are so excited to finally have a destination and a direction! This brings
a whole new level of “realness” to this transition for us.

So here it is… We will be living in
[Grand Bourg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bourg),
a town in the greater Buenos Aires area, Argentina!

Our shared site will be a congregation called San Lucas, part of the IELU
(Iglesia Evangélica Luterana Unida). Fun Fact: The IELU is a companion synod
of our Nebraska Synod, ELCA! Both of us will also have second site, which
we’ll find out more about very soon. We are looking forward to having some
shared experiences and also a chance to work as individuals with unique
gifts to offer.

Our housing will be an apartment in the parsonage, about four blocks from
the church. We are super pumped to be living in an urban area, in the
capital of Argentina, and near the ocean. Rather, we are super pumped about
all of this. Every last detail. We hope you are too!
