After a restful three hours of sleep, we finished some last minute packing,
said our goodbyes, and made our way through airport security. We then
consumed a nutritious airport breakfast (i.e. mystery breakfast pizza)
before boarding our plane for
lovely Chicago. And so the adventure begins...

Over the next six days, all 63 of this year's YAGM's are gathered in one
place. With us are the hardworking program coordinators as well as YAGM
alumni. We will prepare for the upcoming year, engage in conversation about
mission and accompaniment, worship together, and so on.

The air is thick with both excitement and anxiety: excitement for all of the
adventures that lie ahead and anxiety for unknowns that are wrapped up in
each of those adventures.
