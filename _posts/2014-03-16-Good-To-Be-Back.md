title: Good To Be Back

In Argentina, the school year goes from about the beginning of March to the middle of December. This means that summer break consists of the holiday season at the end of December as well as the first two months of the year. In addition to the schools closing for the summer, many other things in our community slowed down or went on hold as people went on vacation and did their best to avoid the heat of summer.

Meulén, one of the places I have been working this year, also took a summer break. For the entirety of the summer I didn't get to go to Meulén because there was simply no one around. Everything is finally back in full swing though. This past week was my first week back. And it is good to be back.

My first day back was Tuesday. Like most Tuesdays, they were doing both pottery and carpentry workshops. In the pottery workshop it looked like they were making mugs. There were a number of things being made in the carpentry workshop. I worked with Ariana measuring and cutting wood with which to frame a piece of artistic pottery that had been made in a past workshop. I enjoy working with Ariana because she is both diligent and patient during the workshops. We weren't sure if the piece of wood in the photo above would be enough to surround the piece of pottery, so once Ariana had measured it all out, she was so excited to find that it was just long enough.

I also attended Meulén on Friday in the morning. I intended to leave around noon when they stop for lunch, but just after noon a heavy downpour started and didn't let up for hours. I normally have other things scheduled on Friday afternoons with the church that I have to go back for, but the rain didn't really make that an option. Instead of getting soaked on the mile walk back, I decided to stay at Meulén for the afternoon.

Someone had recently donated a large piece of wood for painting, so we used it for a group painting project (pictured above). We spent both the morning and the afternoon painting and making various crafts out of leather such as bracelets and wallets.
