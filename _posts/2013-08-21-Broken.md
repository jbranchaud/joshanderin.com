This past week was spent in Chicago. It was a week of orientation comprising
numerous sessions meant to better prepare us for the year ahead. It was also
a week of getting to better know my fellow YAGM and to hear their stories.

These stories were incredibly diverse and fascinating, but what struck me
were the patches of brokenness that stained each of them. People mired in
feelings of doubt and inadequacy, people coming from circumstances and
situations without hope, people struggling with their own shortcomings as
well as with the ways in which they have been deeply hurt by others and so
on. And I, too, was confronted with my own brokenness.

Despite all this brokenness and inadequacy, each of these people is headed
today to various corners of this world to serve. While this might seem crazy
(surely the ELCA could have found people who have it all together, right?!),
it gives me hope. It gives me hope that despite our imperfections and
inability, God still calls us to be part of the new creation that God is
working in this world. Just as God called Moses in the midst of his doubt
and inability, so too does God call each of us, to do things beyond what we
could imagine for ourselves.

In that we can find hope.
