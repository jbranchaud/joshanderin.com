There are a number of cats that live in and around the yard adjoined with
our casita. They all live outside, (usually) run at the sight of an
approaching human, and do not appear to *belong* to anyone -- although I
understand the woman next door sometimes puts food out for them. In a
discussion about these cats, someone referred to them as 'semi-domestic'.
