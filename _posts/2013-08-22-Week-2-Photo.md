Scattered all over the city of Buenos Aires are small parks and plazas that
each take up about a city block. They are places for people to gather to
walk, talk, play, and enjoy being outside. Some have playground equipment,
most have benches and stools, and every once in a while one will have
workout equipment. One of first things we did when we got to Buenos Aires
was go to one of these parks.
