title: Reflections on a funeral

Celia, a beloved woman from Congregación San Lucas passed away Thursday
morning. She hadn’t been exceptionally sick, but she had been growing weaker
and sicker for some time.

We heard about Celia long before we met her. People would refer to the way
Celia used to arrange the altar, how she always called each member of the
church individually to remind them of upcoming events, how she never forgot
a birthday. As she grew frailer, she stopped coming to church regularly, but
we met her once - on December 22nd at the Christmas pageant.

The same day Celia died, a wake was held in the evening in which friends,
family, and the church community gathered to mourn together. There was a lot
of crying, storytelling, and hugging. Every person there approached the
coffin to touch Celia’s head, or her hands. The following morning a small
funeral service was held, and then a burial. No more than 24 hours after she
had died, Celia was lowered into the ground. As part of the graveside
service, everyone threw a handful of dirt onto the coffin. Then we watched
as two men with shovels buried it.

It was healthy for me to experience the death of Celia in such a physical
way: to touch her cold hand, to see that she was not breathing, to pick up
dirt in my hand and help bury her.

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Death is not an abstract disappearance of a
person, but a real, physical, fleshy, earthy event.

I only met Celia once, but she is a big deal for me, and I’ll tell you why.
Blanca, an active member of Congregación San Lucas, has been one of the most
important people in our experience in Grand Bourg. She and her family have
welcomed us and taken us under their wings in so many ways during these last
months. Blanca told me the other day that a few years ago, she set foot in
the congregation for the first time. Her kids went to the school next door,
but she had never been to a church service. She was nervous and intimidated,
not knowing what to expect. But when she set foot in the door, someone
welcomed her. Someone took her under their wing and made her feel at home,
in the same way that she would later do for us. And that person was Celia.

As Pastor Eva reminded us at Celia’s funeral, our bodies are dust, here
today and gone tomorrow. But our *huellas*, the marks that we leave on this
world are what endure and continue to make a difference long after we’re
gone. Thanks be to God for Celia’s life and for Celia’s *huellas*.
