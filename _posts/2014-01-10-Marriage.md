We went on a pastoral visit today with Eva to the home of an elderly couple
from the congregation, Lidia and Élido. It is getting difficult for them to
move around, so they don’t make it to church much anymore. We brought
hymnals to share some music with them, and they brought out soda and cookies
to share a merienda with us.

Élido and Lidia are well into their eighties; they met in school and have
been together ever since. Sixty-three years they have been married.

He keeps chickens out in the backyard. She grows a rosemary bush. He doesn’t
like rosemary, but she chops it up really small and cooks with it anyway.
(Later, he asks what spices she used because the dish tastes really good,
and she gloats.)

He slurs his speech somewhat. When she is cooking, he often talks to her
from the other room, but she can’t understand what he is saying. She has to
stop what she’s doing to go listen to what he says, because he refuses to
come closer.

Sixty-three years Lidia and Élido have been married; we’ve barely been
married sixty-three weeks.

But evidently if I keep tricking him, and if he keeps annoying me, we’re not
doing too bad.
