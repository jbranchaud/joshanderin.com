Erin and I wish we could express how grateful we are for the support that
our communities and congregations have shared with us. Throughout the course
of the summer, we were met with constant excitement and encouragement
as our YAGM year approached. It is clear that we are in the thoughts and
prayers of so many people.

This summer, we had the challenge of raising funds for not just one of us
but both of us. We were successful in that effort. Between the pledges from
a number of congregations and the contributions of so many people from so
many facets of our lives, we were able to reach our fundraising goal. In
particular, the luncheon fundraiser was a big success.

To these many loving communities that send us, we thank you!
