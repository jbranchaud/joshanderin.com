Happy new year from Grand Bourg, Argentina!

We celebrated the new year three hours earlier than we normally do. It was a
surprisingly comfortable evening, meaning that we weren't sweating profusely
as has been the case since about the beginning of December. Our friend,
Juan, invited us to join him and his family for
empanadas, grilled pork, sparkling cider, and lots of fireworks.

We wish you a wonderful 2014!
