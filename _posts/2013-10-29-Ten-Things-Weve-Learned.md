A list of ten things (in no particular order) we’ve learned so far living in
Argentina:

1. You should spring for the more expensive tapas;
[the cheaper ones]({% post_url 2013-09-14-Cheap-Tapas %}) are a lot
harder to work with.

2. How to light the pilot light of a water heater.

3. Saying, ‘Gracias’, during a
[round of mate]({% post_url 2013-10-28-Mate-Community-And-How-The-Church-Cares-For-People-In-Need %})
means that you don’t want any
more, so if you want to keep drinking you must resist the urge to thank the
person who poured it for you.

4. The Lutheran liturgy in Argentina is almost identical to that in the U.S.
Surrounded by much else that is totally new and different, it has been a
great source of comfort for us to already be familiar with many of the words
that are spoken in church.

5. The grocery store might give you some candies as part of your change instead
of the exact change. Unfortunately and unfairly, they do not accept candy as
payment.

6. The birthday party of a 15 year-old girl (a quinceañera) can and will last
until 6:00am. And it’s not just the young partiers that stay that late (or
rather, early),
even families with small children dance till it’s dawn.

7. How to make many traditional kinds of Argentine food such as guiso (a meat
and vegetable stew), milanesa (breaded meat), panqueques (similar to
crepes), and, of course, empanadas.

8. It is a tradition to eat gnocchi on the 29th of each month (we don’t know
why).

9. You always greet and bid farewell to people with a kiss on the cheek (beso).
If you are arriving or leaving and the room is full of people, this means a
lot of kisses.

10. It is more than okay to eat 3 different kinds of meat in a single meal. An
argentine asado typically includes grilled steak, chorizo, and chicken.
