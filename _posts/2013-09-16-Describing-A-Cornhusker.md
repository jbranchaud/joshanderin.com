title: Describing A 'Cornhusker'

As Erin and I prepared for this year in Argentina, we had a number of
opportunities to reflect on our skill sets and how we might utilize them in
Grand Bourg. Erin probably thought of music and imagined singing in a choir
and perhaps playing piano at the occasional church service.
Knowing there would likely not be an opportunity to do anything
computer/technology related, I imagined bringing my energy wherever it was
needed, but especially to activities with the youth.
And of course, there are a
number of less tangible things that we hoped to be able to offer
like an eagerness to listen and a willingness
to share stories and experiences.

Today, we found ourselves offering a skill set that we both possess that
neither of us imagined using.

Our abilities as native English speakers.

The school that is attached to the church we are accompanying offers
optional after-school English classes once a week. We've been given
the opportunity to help out with those classes.

Today was our first day helping out. We essentially supplemented the
existing material by appearing for sometime to be asked questions and to ask
questions ourselves in order to engage the students in a dialogue of
English. To facilitate some of that dialogue we brought a variety of
pictures from *back home*.
Amongst these pictures was one of myself in Memorial Stadium on a sunny Fall
Saturday. I am wearing a corn hat and there is a sea of people dressed in red
over my shoulder.
It was through this picture that we found
ourselves trying to describe to these students what exactly a *cornhusker* is.
