Before heading off to Argentina for our YAGM year, everyone in the 2013-2014
YAGM program met in Chicago for a week of orientation. This orientation
better equipped us for the challenges, joys, and disappointments of the
coming year. The orientation took place on the beautiful campus of the
Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago (LSTC). There was a green space in
the center of the campus lined with flowers like the ones above.
