Over the course of the past year we have received a number of packages and
letters from family and friends. We are really grateful to all of you who
thought to send us something. It was a nice way of continuing to feel
connected to and supported by those who we have been so far from.

As hard as it is to believe, we are now less than a month away from
returning back to Nebraska. There may be some of you reading this who have
been meaning to send something and just kept putting it off (that would be
me if I were in Nebraska, I love procrastination). You might now be
thinking, "Quick, I better send them something before it is too late." You
probably shouldn't.

With packages and mail arriving in an average of three weeks, the chances
are that anything you might now send won't make it before we leave. But
don't sweat it, just come greet us at the airport when we get back! That day
is going to be here before any of us know it.
