title: Our First Wedding Anniversary

It is fairly traditional to pull some cake out of the freezer a year after
your wedding, let it thaw out, and then pray for deliverance from food
poisoning as you tentatively chew and swallow a piece of cake that has a
distinctly different texture from the piece that was hand-fed to you a year
earlier. We embraced this tradition about a month earlier than we should
have: the evening before we left for our YAGM year. We would be spending our
first wedding anniversary in Argentina.

Today is our anniversary. We thought we had already eaten our anniversary
cake, but the San Lucas congregation thought differently. After this
morning's church service, they surprised us with singing, a gift\*, and a
cake, a fresh cake at that!
