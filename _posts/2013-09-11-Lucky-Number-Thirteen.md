Today was our day off this week since we are generally busy and working
during the weekends. We finally got our SUBE cards which allow us to use the
public transportation (subway, train, and bus) and public transportation is
exactly what we needed.

We had been looking for an opportunity to ride into *capital federal*
(Buenos Aires proper) to find a used bookstore. In particular, I was hoping
to find Harry Potter books. In Spanish. Preferably the first book. What
better way to supplement my learning of Spanish than to read a story I am
familiar with that is just above my Spanish reading level.

After an hour train ride from Grand Bourg to Retiro followed by two subway
rides, we were on Corrientes street. As if we had just entered an endless
walk-in closet, we were surrounded on both sides by innumerable clothing
and lingerie stores. We were told we could find a ton of bookstores on
Corrientes, but at that point it didn't seem so promising.

After about five blocks and a few requests for help, we found a used
bookstore. They didn't have a huge selection, but after some searching we
uncovered a used version of the second Harry Potter book.
Not exactly what I was hoping
for, but I didn't have much else to choose from and at 25 pesos, it was the
right price.

I took the book up to the counter, ready to pay. The store clerk glanced at
the number 25 inscribed in pencil just inside the cover of the book and
proceeded to ask me for 75 pesos. As we tried to clear up the discrepancy,
he claimed it was a *new* book and wouldn't budge from the questionable
price. Unsure of whether we were being scammed or just didn't know how
things worked at this store, we said, 'Gracias', and left empty-handed.

As we continued down Corrientes, the bookstores seemingly started
outnumbering the clothing stores. We browsed the shelves of one after another,
visiting eleven additional stores. Each store turned up
nothing, the store clerks inexplicably incredulous that we were looking
for such *obscure* and *childish* books. I was beside myself and remember
remarking to Erin that if I had visited two consecutive used books stores in
the States without finding a Harry Potter book, I would have had to pinch
myself. It was a rare reminder that the kind of on-demand availability
that we expect in the US often doesn't exist other places.

However, in our thirteenth and final attempt, we walked into a tall,
shallow record
store that claimed in its signage to also have books. As we surveyed the single
high wall of books, we craned our necks and spotted towards the top what we
were looking for, the first and second
Harry Potter books, still in their original plastic even. Certain this was my
only chance to buy either, I bought both and we headed home.

It was an empowering adventure for both of us as we found ourselves capable
of utilizing multiple forms of public transportation and able to track down
stores like people probably did in the 90's (without an iPhone). It was also
a day that continued to teach us a lesson I expect we will learn again and
again this year.
Sometimes this world doesn't run at the
precision of an atomic clock, and it probably ought not to.
You might miss the train by three minutes, eleven stores in a row
might not be carrying the one thing you are looking for, and in the end you
might have to walk a bit further than you had anticipated.
In the midst of the *things gone wrong*, you might experience something
unexpected, and that something unexpected might just make a good story.
