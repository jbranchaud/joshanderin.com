Just after the new year, we spent five days at the much-anticipated annual
summer youth *campamento*! The *campamento* is a collaboration between several
Lutheran churches in the Buenos Aires area, and this year the theme of the
*campamento* was “The Five Elements: Water, Air, Fire, Earth, and Love.” We
spent our week focusing on how these five elements show up in our lives,
exploring when and how they show up in the Bible, and learning about
environmental and social ecology around these elements.

This *campamento* was a BLAST! We pitched tents, cooked together, swam in the
pool, walked in the woods, napped in the shade, played together, made crafts
from found objects, prayed together, danced, hung out with a herd of sheep,
did a little bit of yoga, played a crazy game called “Vampire,” and barely
slept at all.

Josh and Ivan (Congregación San Lucas alum and theology student)
collaborated on an all-new “Photography/Videography Workshop” for this
*campamento*, which was a total hit. More than half the campers signed up for
their workshop, and the finished product was a semi-horror story called *“El
bosque de los niños desaparecidos,”* “The Forest of the Disappearing
Children,” written and narrated by the youth and hilariously photographed
and compiled by Josh. It was awesome to see him put his gift for photography
to good use!

My favorite part of the *campamento* was getting to spend more time with the
youth of Congregación San Lucas. They are truly awesome people, and I am so
impressed by their ability to care for each other, work together, and
reflect deeply.
