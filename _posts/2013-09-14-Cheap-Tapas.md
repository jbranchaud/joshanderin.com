Deciding to make empanadas tonight for dinner using some left-over *relleno*
(filling\*), Erin and I swung by the grocery store to pick up some tapas.
Tapas are the bread casings that you wrap around the *relleno*. The brand of
tapas that we've had empanada success with before was out, so we went with
much cheaper off-brand tapas.

In making the empanadas, we found that the tapas tore easily and wouldn't
seal well. We are finding that we can be frugal with a lot of things, but
tapas are not one of them.

Don't buy cheap tapas!

\*this time it was ham, cheese, and hard-boiled egg
