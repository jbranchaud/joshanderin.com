A couple weeks ago someone abandoned three puppies on the side of the road by our house. One of them apparently didn't survive the incident. We were out of town, but our neighbors, who live in a house on the same plot of land, discovered the two survivors and started taking care of them. The puppies spend most of their time in a shed toward the back of the lot for now so that they don't get themselves into too much trouble. Our neighbors are trying to track down someone to take them as pets. So far they have come up empty handed.

Every day when Erin and I are leaving the house or hanging out laundry to dry, the two puppies will hear us and start frantically yipping and barking. They take turns charging at and jumping against the door of the shed to get our attention. Sometimes I will stick my hand in through the window for them. They will jump over one another and knock each other out of the way trying to nuzzle and lick my hand as much as possible.

The solution here is simple, right. We need to just adopt the puppies ourselves (our neighbors' daughter has suggested that multiple times if we weren't already thinking it). Then everything will be all better. This kind of quick fix is at least the temptation anyway.

This situation gets at one of the things I often find myself confronted with this year. Really, it gets at what any person might experience when plunged into a new context or culture. When I see abandonment, brokenness, poverty, and injustice, the obvious reaction is to think, "this is wrong, this needs to stop," and to then try to figure out how to make it better. This is a good gut reaction, but what often follows, the desire for a quick solution, is perhaps where I get off track. Swift solutions are rarely solutions at all, but instead are more like off-brand band-aids that don't stick for very long. Real solutions to the brokenness of this world are more complex, take time, and involve a lot more perspectives, opinions, and voices than just my own.

Perhaps the most important part of this lesson is learning that in some, if not many, cases I myself cannot simply be the solution. Instead, I am meant to go be in the tension with those who are stuck there.
