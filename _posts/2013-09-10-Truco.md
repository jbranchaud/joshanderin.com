This past Saturday evening was the first youth league (youth group) that
Erin and I were able to participate in since arriving in Grand Bourg. It
rained for the entirety of Saturday and though this drove down attendance,
it meant that youth league would be more informal than usual. This left room
for the youth that did brave the rain to teach us the most popular Argentine
card game. Truco!

There are a few aspects of Truco that distinguish it from most other card
games with which I am familiar. First, it is played with what is known as Spanish
playing cards. Spanish playing cards consist of four suits:
sword, stick, gold, and cup. Each suit consists of 12 cards each
rather than the 13 each in a poker deck. There are also jokers, but it
doesn't sound like many games use them. Second, the 8's and 9's (as well as
the jokers) are not used; it is just 1 through 7 and 10 through 12. Third,
it is a game of bluffing which means there are ample opportunities to
pretend you have better cards than you actually do.

The rules are rather complicated, but it is played so often here that most
people seem to have it all memorized. It is a lot of fun, so Erin and I look
forward to teaching friends and family back home how to play.
