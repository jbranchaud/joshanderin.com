Erin and I are hosting a luncheon and fundraiser on August 4th at First
Lutheran Church in Omaha. In addition to enjoying food with family and
friends, there will be a global music concert performed by Erin and friends
as well as a silent auction consisting mainly of original framed photography
by myself.

If you plan to attend the event, please
[RSVP](http://joshanderin-luncheon-fundraiser.eventbrite.com/).

If you are interested in the silent auction, [take a look at some
of the photography](http://joshanderin.com/SilentAuction.html)
that will be up for auction.
