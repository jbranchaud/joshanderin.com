Erin and I are hosting a luncheon and fundraiser on August 4th at First
Lutheran Church in Omaha. In addition to enjoying food with family and
friends, there will be a global music concert performed by Erin and friends
as well as a silent auction consisting mainly of original framed photography
by myself.

If you plan to attend the event, please
[RSVP](http://joshanderin-luncheon-fundraiser.eventbrite.com/).

If you are interested in the silent auction, [take a look at some

that will be up for auction.

Don't worry if you cannot make it to this event, there are still ways to
support us.
In the short-term, we
need financial support. If you would like to support us financially, you can
[download this giving
form](https://github.com/jbranchaud/joshanderin.com/raw/gh-pages/static/YAGMGivingFormBranchaud.pdf)
and follow the instructions for making sure the funds are designated to us.
In the long-term, we need the prayers and encouragement of a community that
*sends* us on this year of service. So, keep us in mind this coming year
by following this blog and keeping an eye out for our monthly newsletters.
And, of course, I will post as many photos as I can.
Feel free to send us emails as well!
