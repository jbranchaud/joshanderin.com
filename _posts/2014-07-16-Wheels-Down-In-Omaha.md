Last night at about 8:00pm we boarded a plane in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
After flying all night and all morning with a brief stop at the Atlanta
International Airport, we have arrived in Omaha.

Though we are a bit exhausted and still grieving the friends and family that
we had to say *chau* (goodbye) to in Argentina, we are excited to once again
say *hello* to the friends and family that we had to say goodbye to almost a
year ago.

Thanks to everyone who supported and prayed for us in this incredible year of
our lives. We hope we are able to share our experiences with all of you and
also hear about the things that filled your lives this past year.
